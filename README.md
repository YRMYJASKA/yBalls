# yBalls
An ideal ellastic circular object collision physics simulator (in real time)

## The Idea
There are a certain amount of balls trapped inside a window of certain dimensions with certain velocities.
yBalls is responsible for computing the collisions and subsequent new velocities of all these balls.

## Requirements
- ```g++```  
- ```make```  
- ```SDL2``` C++ library 

## Building 
1. ```git clone https:://github.com/yrmyjaska/yBalls && cd yBalls```
2. ```make```
3. Run yBalls with ```./yballs```
